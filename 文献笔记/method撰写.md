# __Methods__
## 1. __Acoustic Device fabication__
A 10-millimeter-thick acrylic board/board/sheet was laser-cut according to the design provided in Figure S1 and assembled with acrylic glue to form a waterproof square acrylic chamber (21mm x 21mm x 10mm). A pair of PZTs (20mm x 10mm; frequency 3MHz, Yantai Xingzhiwen Trading Co., Ltd.) were pasted to the relative outer walls of the acrylic chamber with epoxy resin, with a spacing of 21mm, an integer multiple of λ/2 to ensure the formation of BAW. The PZTs were connected in parallel to the RF signal generator (DG5352, Rigol) and power independent driver amplifier (LCY-22+, Minicircuit), providing a 3MHz sine voltage waveform.


## 2. Cell culture
Human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line C3A cells were cultured/maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium (Gibco) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Gibco) and 1% penicillin–streptomycin (Invitrogen, PA) in T75 flask. The cells were cultivated in a humidified incubator at 5% CO2 and 37 °C,The medium is changed every two days and rinsed with PBS when changing,., cells were harvested with 0.05% trypsin-EDTA (Gibco) for sub-culture or cell suspension preparation At 80% confluence.

## 7.Controlling the hepatic cord size
通过调控频率控制肝索的间距和尺寸，将C3A细胞悬浮在8%的GelMA溶液中，分别采用3 Mhz、6、9的声学参数对细胞进行排列；通过调控细胞浓度来控制肝索的尺寸


## 8. Acoustically patterned hepatic cord tissue
 Prior to the experiment, the devices used were soaked in 75% ethanol, wiped dry and sterilized with ultraviolet light for 1 hour.C3A cells cultured in a T75 flask were harvested and evenly suspended in 5x10^6 cells /mL with Prepared inks (8% w/v GelMA and 0.5% w/v LAP),Bioink with cells was added to the cavity, and the signal input,so that the cells are arranged into Continuous parallel lines
